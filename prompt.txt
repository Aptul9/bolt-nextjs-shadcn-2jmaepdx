I am using prisma ORM, I want you to write a schema for my supabase (postgres) environment.
All the id must be uuid, you can change the name a bit if you find better names
The followings are the tables that i want to have:

1) tenants:
    id (primary key)
    subscription_type (string)
    expiration (date)
    user_id (string)

2) users:
    id (primary key)
    tenant_id (foreign key)
    expiration (date)
    name (string)
    access_left (int - optional) (it defines how many access a person has left, if you can find a better name use it)

3) users_info:
    user_id (foreign key, primary key)
    tenant_id (foreign key)
    birth_date (date - optional)
    address (string - optional)
    phone number (string - optional)
    birth_place (string - optional)
    ssn (string - optional)
    -- add any parameters that we might want for people if needed

4) access_logs:
    id (primary key)
    timestamp (date)
    tenant_id (foreign key)
    user_id (foreign key)
